        <p id="carP">This is a example of the amount of emmisons coming of just a few
            cars sitting in traffic. Vehicals are responsible for a massive amount of CO2 emmisonslet into the
            atmasphere every year
            sadly in 2022 the total amount of emmisions from vehicals increased by 1.4% to 3.53 billion metric tons.
            However there is a clean
            and sustainable replacment to these vehicals. Click the button to go green and find out what!
        </p>
        <p id="elecP">Ah thats better! These are eletric cars where they give off no harmful emmisions into the Earths
            atmasphere,
            but instead are pluged in and charged where it can take on electrcity into its large battiers and use this
            to power
            the vehical all while producing no CO2.

        <p id="colP">This is a coal powered plant, as we can see veery karge amounts of emmisions are being let off into
            the atmasphere
            with coal buring being responsible for many environmentally harful chemicals being released making it very
            unsustainable.Coal
            buring releases 10,000 tons of sulphur dioxide every year which is responsible for acid rain. Hit the button
            to see a much more
            sustainable form of energy.
        </p>
        <p id="solP">Ah thats better! This is a industrial campus that is fully powered through solar energy. As you can
            see there are a hugh amount of
            solar panles lining the roof of the campus which absord solar rays or sunlight and are capable of converting
            it into electrical energy.
            This type of energy is complety renewable and fully sustainable.

        <p id="oilP">This is a protroleum plant or oil plant. These plants are reponsible for many harmful toxins beiing
            released into the atmasphere
            This can be done through oil spills and the release of waste products which contain many hydrocarbons, heavy
            metals, radioactive materials and
            toxic chemicals all of which are deadly to vegitation and soils. General air pollution from these plants
            also contribute to large amounts of
            agricultural damage.
        </p>
        <p id="windP">Ah thats better! These are turbines which are responsible for producing wind energy, they do this
            through a very simple process
            of allowing wind to turn the large propellors which spin around a rotor which spins a genrator that then
            creates electrcity.This is one of the
            oldest forms of renewable energy.

    <div id="nucEnergy">
        <p id="nucP">This is a nuclear energy plant. How they produce energy is through the heating process in the
            nuclear reactor which heats water to produce
            steam that then turns a turbine. This means that this form of energy is in fact renewable however this
            process leaves nuclear waste which
            is extremly toxic to anything it interacts with including all fish and bacteria life in water and vegataion
            and plant life.
        </p>
        <p id="hydroP">Ah thats better! This is a hydro energy dam which uses the power of the water to once again turn
            large turbines and create
            clean, renwable and sustainable energy.
